# DataClicker
DataClicker is a simple clicker game I originally made in C++ in February 2024 before porting it to Python.

<sup>idk what else to type here so I'll go straight to the "setting up" part</sup>
## Setting up
1. Go to the "Releases" tab, download and extract the source code of the latest version available.
2. Install the required Python libraries by typing this command into the terminal: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\
   **Make sure to enter that command in the folder containing DataClicker!**
3. Launch `DataClicker.py`

And that's it! Enjoy playing my game (somehow)
